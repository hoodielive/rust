** Data Types in Rust 
*** Booleans
    + Booleans are true or false 
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
         let x = true; 
         let x2: bool = true; 
         let y = false; 
         let y2 =  x && true; 
         println!("y is {}", y); 
      #+END_SRC
*** Characters
    + Characters are not 8 bit unsigned integers like in C
    + Rather, they are unicode scalars, meaning Rust fully support unicode out of the box
      #+BEGIN_SRC rust
          let c: char = "A"; 
          let d: char = "â™¥"; 
      #+END_SRC

*** Integers 
*** Floating-Point Integers
*** Arrays
*** Slices
*** Tuples
